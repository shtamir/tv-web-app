## **1. Managing Requirements**

Let's begin by detailing the requirements for each feature.

### **Functional Requirements**

1. **Header**
   - Display a static or dynamic header across all pages.

2. **Time and Date**
   - Show the current time and date, updating in real-time.

3. **Family Messages**
   - Retrieve messages from a Google Sheets document.
   - Sync new messages periodically or on-demand.

4. **Family Photos**
   - Display photos from a shared Google Photos album.
   - Implement a slideshow feature with adjustable intervals.

5. **Current Weather Forecast**
   - Fetch and display weather data using an API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
   - Update weather information at regular intervals.

6. **News Breaks**
   - Retrieve news headlines using RSS feeds or APIs.
   - Allow customization of news sources.

7. **To-Do List**
   - Sync tasks from a Google Sheets document.
   - Provide an interface to add or remove tasks (optional).

### **Non-Functional Requirements**

- **Performance**
  - Fast loading times, even on limited hardware.
- **Usability**
  - User-friendly interface suitable for TV screens.
- **Compatibility**
  - Must run smoothly on Android TV web browsers.
- **Maintainability**
  - Code should be well-documented and modular.

## **2. Design**

### **Architecture Overview**

Given your preference for Python and avoidance of the Android framework, we'll focus on building a web application using Python-based web technologies.

#### **Client-Server Model**

- **Client**: The Android TV web browser displays the web application.
- **Server**: A Python web server handles data processing and serves content to the client.

### **Technology Stack**

- **Backend Framework**: Flask (lightweight and easy to learn) or Django (more features but steeper learning curve).
- **Frontend Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (you'll need to learn some basics).
- **APIs and Libraries**:
  - **Google Sheets API**: For syncing messages and to-do lists.
  - **Google Photos API**: For fetching family photos.
  - **Weather API**: Like OpenWeatherMap for weather data.
  - **RSS Feed Parser**: Libraries like `feedparser` for news feeds.
- **Version Control**: Git, managed via GitLab.

### **Data Flow**

1. **Data Retrieval**
   - The server fetches data from external APIs and Google services.
2. **Data Processing**
   - The server processes and formats the data.
3. **Content Delivery**
   - The server renders templates and sends them to the client browser.
4. **Client-Side Interactivity**
   - Minimal JavaScript to handle dynamic content updates if necessary.

### **Avoiding Android Framework**

By building a web application that runs in the browser, you eliminate the need for Android-specific development. This approach leverages standard web technologies that are compatible with Android TV browsers.

## **3. UML Diagrams**

Creating UML diagrams will help visualize the system's components and their interactions.

### **Types of UML Diagrams**

1. **Use Case Diagram**
   - Illustrates system functionality from an end-user perspective.
2. **Class Diagram**
   - Shows the system's classes, attributes, operations, and relationships.
3. **Sequence Diagram**
   - Details the sequence of operations for specific functionalities.
4. **Activity Diagram**
   - Represents workflows of stepwise activities.

### **Tools for Creating UML Diagrams**

- **Lucidchart** (Online)
- **Draw.io** (Online and Free)
- **StarUML** (Desktop Application)
- **Visual Paradigm** (Offers Community Edition)

## **Implementation Plan**

### **Step 1: Set Up Development Environment**

- Install Python 3.x.
- Set up a virtual environment.
- Install necessary Python packages (`flask`, `requests`, `google-api-python-client`, etc.).

### **Step 2: Learn Basic Web Technologies**

Since you're not familiar with web development, here's a brief learning path:

- **HTML**: Structure of web pages.
- **CSS**: Styling of web pages.
- **JavaScript**: Interactivity on web pages (keep minimal).

### **Step 3: Backend Development**

- **Flask App Structure**
  - Create a Flask application with separate routes for each feature.
- **API Integration**
  - Use Google's APIs to access Sheets and Photos.
  - Fetch weather data using a weather API.
  - Parse RSS feeds for news.

### **Step 4: Frontend Development**

- Design templates using HTML and Jinja2 (Flask's templating engine).
- Apply CSS to ensure the app is visually appealing on a TV screen.
- Ensure the UI is navigable using a remote control.

### **Step 5: Testing**

- Test the application on a desktop browser.
- Test on the Android TV browser to ensure compatibility.

### **Step 6: Deployment**

- Choose a hosting solution (see below).
- Set up continuous integration and deployment using GitLab CI/CD pipelines.

## **Version Control with GitLab**

- **Repository Setup**
  - Create a new project in GitLab.
  - Push your local repository to GitLab.

- **Branching Strategy**
  - Use `master` or `main` for stable code.
  - Develop new features in separate branches.

- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**
  - Set up GitLab CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
  - Use `.gitlab-ci.yml` to define the pipeline stages.

## **Additional Considerations**

### **Learning Resources**

- **Flask Official Documentation**
  - [Flask Documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)
- **Google APIs**
  - [Google Sheets API](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python)
  - [Google Photos Library API](https://developers.google.com/photos/library/guides/overview)
- **Frontend Development**
  - [W3Schools HTML Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)
  - [W3Schools CSS Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/)

### **Security**

- Keep your API keys and credentials secure.
- Use environment variables or configuration files not checked into version control.

### **Scalability**

- While the initial user base is your family, design the app so it can handle more data or users if needed.
